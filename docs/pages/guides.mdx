## Folder structure
There are no rules on how to structure stores, but working with exome for couple of years now across multiple very large projects I can make some suggestions:

1. Try to make 1 file per store;
2. Try to name store files ending with `*.store.ts`, `*.store.js`;

```txt
user.store.ts
user-list.store.ts
```

3. Try to name stores ending with `*Store`;
    - It's easy to confuse store names with component names later.

```ts
class UserStore extends Exome {}
class UserListStore extends Exome {}
```

4. Try to base all logic inside actions instead of components;
    - It's way easier to manage data flow via actions while UI frameworks only display data, UI and trigger user events.
5. If you're going with `features` folder structure, then put store there too:

```txt
my-project/
├── features/
│   └── jsonlogic-editor/
│       ├── jsonlogic-editor.component.tsx
│       └── jsonlogic-editor.store.ts
│   ...
```

6. If you're have different folder structure, then put stores together:

```txt
my-project/
├── components/
│   ...
├── stores/
│   ├── settings.store.ts
│   └── user.store.ts
│   ...
```

Now you may not follow these suggestions and maybe find some better way to handle things, might as well [open issue](https://github.com/Marcisbee/exome/issues) revealing that info with everyone.
