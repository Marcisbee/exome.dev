## Middleware

Middleware is helping mechanism for detecting update events before and after they are finished.

It's similar to `update` function, but instead of listening to one store instance, it listens to every single store instance at the same time. Every action will trigger middleware.

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
import { Exome, addMiddleware } from "exome"
// ---cut---
class CounterStore extends Exome {
  public count = 0
  public add(count: number) {
    this.count += count
  }
}

addMiddleware((instance, action, payload) => {
  console.log("start", action)
  return (error) => {
    console.log("end", action)
  }
});

// @log: log: "start NEW"
const counterStore = new CounterStore()

counterStore.add(5)
// @log: log: "start add"
// @log: log: "end add"
```

If current actions are not enough, `runMiddleware` can trigger custom middleware actions.

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
import { Exome, runMiddleware } from "exome"
class CounterStore extends Exome {
  public count = 0
  public add(count: number) {
    this.count += count
  }
}

const counterStore = new CounterStore()
// ---cut---
// @log: log: "start CUSTOM_ACTION"
const after = runMiddleware(counterStore, "CUSTOM_ACTION", [])

// do something in between

// @log: log: "end CUSTOM_ACTION"
after();
```

Note that middleware will NOT trigger instance update events itself since it acts on them. But in case this is needed, you can use `update` function to update specific instance.

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
import { Exome, addMiddleware } from "exome"
class CounterStore extends Exome {
  public count = 0
  public add(count: number) {
    this.count += count
  }
}

// ---cut---
import { update } from "exome"

addMiddleware((instance, action, payload) => {
  if (action === "CUSTOM_ACTION") {
    update(instance)
  }
})
```
